Numpy (and Pandas) are the #1 libraries for Machine Learning, there is no way you can do anything without it. 

This interactive tutorial will help you become familiar on it, master the most used functionalities and help you clean up your first datasets.

- Numpy documentation.
- Vectors.
- Matrix.
- Random, Mean Values.

Note: The entire tutorial is 👆 interactive, ✅ auto-graded and with 📹 video tutorials.

## One click installation:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/breatheco-de/numpy-tutorial-exercises)


## Local Installation

1. Install `learnpack`, `packet manager` for learning tutorials and the html `compiler plugin` for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 12+:

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python
```

2. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:

```sh

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but it is very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.
