# `000` Welcome to NumPy!

We are very excited to have you here! 🎉 😂

NumPy is an open-source Python library used to perform various mathematical and scientific tasks.

It allows us to perform numerical calculations in Python. We will use it mainly because we can  create and modify arrays, and do operations on them with ease.

## 💬 Fundamentals:

During this course, we are going to show you the most popular NumPy's functionalities. Also, we will be talking a little bit about:

+ Why should we use NumPy?

+ Installation and Import.

+ NumPy array creation and its attributes.

+ Basic mathematical operations.

+ Array Manipulation functions, and many other cool things!
